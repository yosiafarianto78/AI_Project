# Mask-Detect-

This is a Computer Vision project. We train the model until it gets the best accuracy to detect someone is wearing a mask or not from the image.
- Dataset imported from kaggle
- After we get the majority of correct detections for the kaggle dataset, 
the next step is to detect each member in the Artificial Intelligence class whether they use a mask or not.
